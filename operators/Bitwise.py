# Python Bitwise operators
"""Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits. They operate bit by bit,
   hence the name . For example, 2 is 10 in binary, and 7 is 111 ."""

a = 10
b = 4
print("a & b =", a & b)     # AND
print("a | b =", a | b)     # OR
print("a ^ b =", a ^ b)     # XOR
print("~a =", ~a)           # NOT
print("a >> 1 =", a >> 1)   #right shift
print("b >> 1 =", b >> 1)
print("a << 1 =", a << 1)   #left shift
